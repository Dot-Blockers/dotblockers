#### 1. Fast and Easy KYC/KYB
Once you create your account and verify your email address, you will be prompted to fill in some information about yourself, otherwise known as KYC (Know Your Customer).

#### 2. Fast Transactions
Youâ€™ll usually get your first partial rent payment that same day, and daily after that. Your holdings will grow along with the property value, too.

#### 3. Security
Forget expensive brokers and lock-in periods. Easily reinvest your rental income for the long term, or list your holdings for sale, whenever you like.
